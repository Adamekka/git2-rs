  # These success/failure jobs are here to consolidate the total
  # success/failure state of all other jobs. These jobs are then included in
  # the GitHub branch protection rule which prevents merges unless all other
  # jobs are passing. This makes it easier to manage the list of jobs via this
  # yml file and to prevent accidentally adding new jobs without also updating
  # the branch protections.
  #
  # Unfortunately this requires two jobs because the branch protection
  # considers skipped jobs as successful. The status check functions like
  # success() can only be in an `if` condition.
  #
  # Beware that success() is false if any dependent job is skipped. See
  # https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/45058. This means there
  # cannot be optional jobs. One workaround is to check for all other
  # statuses:
  #     (contains(needs.*.result, 'cancelled') || contains(needs.*.result, 'skipped') || contains(needs.*.result, 'failure'))
  # but that is a mess.
